kadakpav,2025-02-08T04:33:13.482Z,"I was the biggest critic of the move to nerf the S Pen. I however think, this is just going to play like the headphone jack."
sumiregalaxxy,2025-02-08T10:59:43.971Z,"They should've completely removed it and replaced it with something better such as better battery tech and better display and cameras, but they didn't."
mayankgulia,2025-02-08T07:43:07.325Z,This post doesn't feel like a usage review. More like a stats page with thoughts on other devices. I don't entirely disagree with expressed views. Just doesn't match the title.
shash747,2025-02-08T11:43:44.416Z,I use all my phones without a case or screen protectors.
Craig653,2025-02-08T06:32:00.910Z,Samsung used to be top dog And for 1500 dollars it needs to be.
RandomBloke2021,2025-02-08T04:04:01.503Z,After a week it gets a 9.5/10 for me. From display to battery and the camera it's been incredible. The only issue is the size and using it one handed. 100% happy with my purchase. Choose what works best for you.
Cynaren,2025-02-08T07:36:59.190Z,"Yea, my pinky is not used to this new weight category."
Maxcyber_,2025-02-08T07:27:23.696Z,I came from iphone15 pro max to the s25u. Also got it for a couple of days now and feel quite comfortable with it.
Ok_Camp_6114,2025-02-08T15:05:56.149Z,At this stage Apple and Samsung should release a new phone every two or three years.
Maddezire,2025-02-08T03:58:54.759Z,"It's better than the predecessor in a safe way , nothing extraordinary new , some minor fixes and better improved chip . However besides all that I noticed it's a bit over smoothened. Screen touch sensitivity is a bit like sliding on ice . S23 ultra felt more responsive"
Neat-Pace4663,2025-02-08T05:44:43.135Z,Thanx for making me glad I'm keeping my S24U for a while longer!
SatayMY,2025-02-08T09:21:54.976Z,iPhone saving grace is their Apple ecosystem.
_1_nap_1_,2025-02-08T04:13:42.126Z,"This actually feels like a solid review. My takeaway would be the S pen. This would make me lean towards S25 Plus to be better than the S25 Ultra. The S pen downgrade is something that I acknowledge, but I don't think most people would ever need the S pen. It's a good addition (when it's done right), but it's not a necessity. The S25 Plus has a lot in common with the Ultra like a close to same battery size and the same processor (which is not the case for the previous S24 lineup where only the Ultra gets the Snapdragon 8 gen processor)"
Comfortable_Flow1385,2025-02-08T04:37:57.441Z,"You're being delusional. Vivo and pixel don't have the best camera. Watch any comparison on YouTube and you'll see the ultra outperforming both in most categories, and even iPhone in many categories. And the SOT on oneplus is only 30 minutes more than Samsung, despite having a 1000 mah bigger battery."
HypNotiQIV,2025-02-08T05:16:53.537Z,"gotta agree on the pixel point
I lasted longer with my pos xiaomi than I did with my pixel."
reddit_warrior_24,2025-02-08T07:50:25.089Z,"i inquired about the one plus and it aint even available in my country. so ya, these two remain on top"
sukho205,2025-02-08T09:38:53.439Z,"honestly coming from the iphone 16 pro, 45w charging feels blazing fast. When I left my job with 50% remaining on my 16P it only goes up to about 65-70% by the time I get home using my car charger. S25U gets up to 80-90%. Now I regained the peace of mind of knowing that even if I'm in a bit of a rush I can still secure a good amount of charge. Would be great if it had better capacity and faster speed, but I guess samsung might be trying to be conservative so they won't make exploding phones again."
Hot-Risk4643,2025-02-08T07:45:07.453Z,"Does it overheats when playing games? I have s22 and matter of facts, Im using it now."
Fair-Pace-6973,2025-02-08T10:38:16.789Z,"My s25 was getting me 8 hours going from 85% to 15% I can't imagine going with a phone other than Samsung. Yea they may not be ""innovative enough"" but their phones are all I need! It's has everything, as you said as a whole they are amazing"
Tough_Attention_7293,2025-02-08T15:56:58.607Z,Having a S24 Ultra and a Pixel XL 9 Pro I can tell you first hand Samsung wins. Pixel is all hype and I switched back and forth and did Xmas videos on both phones and all agreed the S24 Ultra. I often think people just list the Pixel as the best camera and don't actually do a comparison.
NoIdeaWhatToD0,2025-02-08T19:23:12.255Z,How was the S Pen downgraded?
minitaba,2025-02-08T20:19:34.109Z,No bluetooth anymore
Apple-Connoisseur,2025-02-08T06:25:25.690Z,As long as people still keep buying the new phone they wonâ€™t change.
ATShields934,2025-02-08T07:33:52.749Z,Thank you for your thoughts.
jaguyoyo,2025-02-08T08:15:51.197Z,"This was a well reasoned review. I've also switched from the S24U. The S25U is a bit of an 'S -year' phone but that's not to say it's a bad phone. In all the key metrics it's near the top for sure. And in terms of general use it's definitely improved Vs the S25U. Battery life is better in my experience. Fluidity whilst moving between apps is excellent, probably iPhone level. Screen is lovely and I love the anti reflective coating. Camera has definitely improved, with it taking sharper pictures at both zoom and non zoom. S24U had this issue where it would take washed out looking pics in certain scenarios where there was bright light. I would upgrade for that reason alone tbh. Ergonomically I recalled liked the curved sides of the 24 phone, I miss those tbh. But on the flip side I appreciate the curved corners of the 25. I think they should've retained the curved sides and potentially gave it curved corners ðŸ¤·."
Subject_Session_1164,2025-02-08T16:05:10.724Z,"Considering the hoops you have to jump through, to me they were banned already"
buy1981,2025-02-08T08:54:57.127Z,"I got mine like a week ago and I must say I am pleased so far, even coming from the s24U."
Ok_Priority_5298,2025-02-08T09:38:30.047Z,"Got my s25 ultra 3 days back and here are my thoughts (been using iPhone for 6 years - from iphone 12 pro, 13 pro and 14 pro)."
midnightRequestLine1,2025-02-08T20:59:50.798Z,Live call translation is very impressive. As is AI built in throughout phone features.
Subject_Session_1164,2025-02-08T15:57:29.936Z,Lol
papaShip,2025-02-08T13:06:51.534Z,"I noticed you mentioned fast charging, I recently watched a few comparison videos lately and actually seen that the s25 ultra is only 5ish minutes slower than the onePlus 13"
that_georgia_girl,2025-02-08T14:12:20.672Z,"I haven't spent a lot of time playing around with mine, but is there a way to get the notification bar to show by pulling down from the top rather than the menu (?) bar (photo attached)"
Ancient_Welder_8403,2025-02-08T22:25:08.224Z,From that screen click on the pen icon > panel setting > together
nakrohtap,2025-02-08T14:37:47.294Z,"Assuming it's the same as the S24U with OneUi 7, you have to swipe down on the left side (or opposite side depending on your settings)."
rainbowcatcher2020,2025-02-08T19:06:23.481Z,Great phone but OneUI 7 is a step back.
Samerai19,2025-02-09T01:55:31.022Z,"Adding to Samsung negatives: the utter garbage customer service. I was sent a damaged phone that I had ordered through their website. A damage that I had reported within hours of receiving the shipment, and I have video of the unboxing to prove it."
kimahri27,2025-02-09T06:35:47.313Z,Sounds like the same talking points the paid shills on YouTube use to criticize both Samsung and Apple in an attempt to bolster shitty Chinese brands. Chinese people don't willingly buy Chinese phones outside of China if they have the choice. Regurgitating misleading spec advantages doesn't change the quality of the end product.
NickPookie93,2025-02-09T18:28:54.263Z,All these years later and Samsung still can't figure out the shutter lag lol
iadorebrandon,2025-02-10T16:43:01.692Z,The glazing for stock android continues
noah-rim-riddle,2025-02-08T07:37:09.047Z,I bought the S25 after using an iPhone for 8 years and I really love it so far
hell0xsilly,2025-02-08T07:40:47.335Z,"I just pre ordered mine and after using iPhones since smartphones existed, Iâ€™m excited!"
etnie007,2025-02-08T07:40:38.867Z,"I purchased a few cases, tried them on ended up with 3 that I can keep as I'm limited with what cases I can use due to the right hand side - which I will call a ""design fault"". This case is firmly on and I just can't look at this so I have to get certain cases that cover the whole side up like the Crocs case, spigen zero one. The screen is dirty as tried many cases and struggled to get them off!"
lukeroux1,2025-02-08T09:48:12.177Z,Why are you giving the best battery to 16 pro and S25u when x200pro and Oppo find X8 pro are much better?
Elarionus,2025-02-08T11:53:08.985Z,"Because battery size is not the same as battery life. Those operating systems suck at optimization, and the iPhone and Samsung consistently kick their trash in tests."
sOFrOsTyyy,2025-02-08T10:22:56.909Z,"Really curious why ""Best Battery"" went to the S25U over the OnePlus 13?"
Elarionus,2025-02-08T11:56:40.764Z,Because battery size doesnâ€™t matter if the software optimization is crap.
shash747,2025-02-08T11:42:39.587Z,My biggest problem right now is the design - it's super hard to adjust to the sharpness of the top and bottom frame - my ears hurt every time I take a call.
Weak_Departure9749,2025-02-08T11:51:26.745Z,"giving software to pixel feels like a scam i have used that crap, it's so feature less and it gets so buggy after every update"

Andysmith1307,2025-02-08T13:13:47.835Z,"I have come from the s23 ultra. I think the s25u is nice, I like the form of the phone. First things I noticed is that it's alot lighter than my previous s23u. The s pen in the s23u is better. And I don't just mean features. It feels more solid, where as the s25u s spen feels very light and cheap. I think I'll never use the s pen."
Ancient_Welder_8403,2025-02-09T01:19:47.153Z,"I hate the icons and widgets on the S25U, the layout and visual icons and widgets where 10x as better on the S23 than they are on the S25U, so much so I've gone back to use the S23U"
Marrks23,2025-02-08T14:19:51.519Z,"I found way more annoying borderline stalker Gemini than Apple intelligence, the latter has a big ass switch button that completely deactivates it and lets you with regular siri"
Dull-Wave1410,2025-02-08T16:07:25.419Z,No fast charging? WTH? Glad I usually skip a generation when it comes to my phones.
oktwentyfive,2025-02-08T16:16:26.214Z,"Its a very safe clean phone but i really do not like Samsung going down this iphone route taking away customization (AOD screen) treating its users like they are incapable of doing cool things with phones and such, making their phones safe and non innovative i buy Samsung for the innovation and customization. Not the AI i barley use. Not the ease of access like iphone."
Bek-the_explorer,2025-02-08T16:44:50.887Z,"But it has overall greatness, and leap in actual user experience, and specs will just come their way"
Zulu_Baba_Warrior,2025-02-08T16:44:54.319Z,
rotacurly,2025-02-08T16:55:03.640Z,"Personally I like, not really a pen user. A had a note 10 a long time ago. The camera button is nice but you can easily enable voice commands. Much lighter and more comfortable to hold than s25U. If you want faster wireless charging usually you need some specialized charger and I have a lot of regular 15w qi chargers around the house. Solid trade in deals. Good camera. Not disappointed at all coming from an s24+"
KaaleenBaba,2025-02-08T18:00:20.677Z,How is s25 ultra the best battery when the phones like the new oneplus has much better silicon carbide battery?
ZlagathaChristie,2025-02-08T18:41:42.630Z,No fast charging? As in they removed it ?
Wrong-Masterpiece730,2025-02-08T22:15:58.286Z,I also got it 7 days ago and honestly disappointed with the cameras. Everything except is fine. I mostly take portraits and 3x and 5x telephoto are the best to take portraits but 5x is too close and 3x is just 10mp.
Deadchamber26,2025-02-09T00:16:05.045Z,"Lucky you got yours! I pre-ordered the day pre-orders went live and have yet to receive mine. I called Videotron, my phone company about tracking information and they have no information or updates. I have to wait for a shipping label to be created and they're estimating March 14th."
midweastern,2025-02-09T00:20:55.122Z,What do you mean the S25U doesn't have fast charging?
iadorebrandon,2025-02-10T16:44:22.217Z,It gets the full 45W charging because it comes with the 3A cord. But Samsung has corrected it so that now you can use any 45W charger brick and still get the full 45W. OP is confused
sori97,2025-02-10T05:57:43.583Z,"It does have it. Source: im using it right now. I think OP might be confused because it doesnt say fast charging where it usually does pre one ui 7. But if you compare the estimated time to charge with the setting on and off, there is a drastic visible change"
Stakegirl,2025-02-09T00:42:28.394Z,I last had the 22 Ultra. I loved it but the auto correct was really off base. So I sold it and went back to iphone. Last year I rejoined the Samsung family with the 24 Ultra. But this time I was quite disappointed in two aspects.
AeroSatan,2025-02-09T00:55:58.259Z,â€œ Deep thoughts by Jack Handy â€œ
No-Recording4376,2025-02-09T04:09:22.513Z,Only reason in upgrading is because my s22 ultra is due for an upgrade. And its going to cost very little with ATT trade in program.
ExcitingBlock686,2025-02-09T04:09:44.163Z,I disagree with Best Software for Pixel. OneUI + Good Lock + Good Guardians is just above any Android skins. Once you configure One Hand Operation + it simply becomes difficult to switch to other Android Skin.
Gatorblitz,2025-02-09T05:55:02.115Z,Came from a s23 ultra and the one thing I can't stand is that looking at the screen from certain angles the screen is completely black and I can't see a thing
Scoop2O8,2025-02-09T07:22:00.295Z,Lack of fast charging?? Please explain
xspeed20,2025-02-09T16:30:47.258Z,I hate they remove the bluetooth s penbut then I realised I never used it when I was using s23 ðŸ˜‚
Sageforce69,2025-02-09T20:02:00.988Z,"Best battery goes for vivo x200 pro.not iPhone , neither s25 ultra."

idngessnio,2025-02-10T00:52:57.283Z,You articulate your experience simply and well . Have you had a go at the Pixel 9 Pro XL ? I'd love your take on it .
BeyondMysterious2025,2025-02-10T05:40:35.193Z,Why do you guys like stock android this much I hated it. Everyone was going it's the best shit out there and I told my mom to buy a pixel she was using a samsung. You can't even add shortcuts for call and camera in lock screen corners.
Interesting_Music413,2025-02-10T19:42:15.706Z,And here I am still using my Note 10 Plus since 2019 & thriving.

GoatApprehensive9866,2025-02-14T15:35:00.007Z,"Yup. Camera, processing speed for fractal rendering/video editing, and display outweigh any nitpicks I have, even the s-pen remote shutter (which is saying a LOT)."

benrb7,2025-02-20T10:57:55.493Z,What if Samsung release a new S pen with Bluetooth capabilities for remote shutter/gestures but also a built in microphone. 
dkim_88,2025-02-25T08:10:31.715Z,"Iâ€™ve partnered with Samsung, and in my opinion, I can tell you that the Galaxy S25 Ultra is absolutely worth the upgrade. I totally get why youâ€™d be on the fence, well cause phones are a big investment. But after getting hands-on time with my friendâ€™s S25 Ultra, I can confidently say this phone is next-level (dare I say, out of this ""Galaxy"")."
Few_Influence2465,2025-02-25T20:10:03.619Z,"3 weeks S25ult 1td stock decided to go into a boot loop yesterday. took to samsung service center, now a brick. 19 days old. samsung corp service says needs to be sent to them, 1 business week to look at it, then they will decide to fix or replace. should have something back to me in about 2 weeks. oh, i also paid for most expensive care+. close to$2000.00 three weeks ago and now two weeks with no phone. anyone who buys any samsung products, be aware once they have your money it is Fyou"
AndroidDigest,2025-02-26T21:31:38.456Z,"I'm a content creator, and yes, I do partner with Samsung Galaxy, but I've reviewed and looked into a lot of the devices you are talking about. But the S25 Ultra really stands above the rest as far as quality."
Chinnyman,2025-03-05T17:20:10.979Z,S25 still has shutter lag?
DRAYGANN,2025-03-08T18:18:22.427Z,What are your thoughts and experience with the PWM of the Samsung s25 ultra? Maybe in comparison to your previous phone or an iPhone
sumiregalaxxy,2025-02-08T10:57:19.445Z,"It's because they literally re-released the Galaxy S24 ultra but with a different chip and more awful design in the camera (and nerfed S pen NEVEE FORGET JUST LIKE 1% OF PEOPLE WHO USED IT THEY SAY). THAT'S IT. I am a loyal Samsung knight and also a previous employee, but what they did on the S25 series really made me mad."
pwpawel,2025-02-08T09:08:36.347Z,I switched from iPhone and I must san that this Phone is great but...
Elarionus,2025-02-08T11:56:10.989Z,"Ironically, the separate volume control is something that most Android users hate about iPhones. I donâ€™t want my phone dinging for every stupid email. Just phone calls need to make sound, everything else can wait."
Aggressive_Hat_9999,2025-02-09T00:30:11.854Z,you can set volume control to control all volume with the same button in the setti gs
Ancient_Welder_8403,2025-02-08T22:18:41.811Z,"My gripe with the S25 is that they've changed the clock and weather widget, and it now looks cold, woke and soulless, much prefer the one from the S21/S23"
Ancient_Welder_8403,2025-02-08T22:21:25.922Z,"Also not a fan of that you to have to press ok when you put a 4 digit pin in, it's now 6 digits instead to get the option ""confirm PIN without tapping ok"" instead of 4, pissed me right off when that was removed not only for the S25, but also my S23"
